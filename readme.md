# Simple suggestion box

Practice project to make a simple but efficient suggestion box.
Built with PHP, utilizing some third party packages.
Not built with or as any specific framework, but code to perform one specific purpose.


## Goals
- Built with PHP
- Use Redis for caching
- Use MySQL database for storage
- Simple Vue.JS driven front end
- Gets existing entries as you enter a new one to see if your suggestion was already added
- Multiple entries for the same suggestion makes that entry appear more prominently, sorter earlier.
